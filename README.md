# insurance-analytics-kaim-week3
This project explores structured insurance data to uncover patterns in claims, policy characteristics, and customer behavior. Using statistical distributions and hypothesis testing, we analyze variables such as claim amounts, vehicle profiles, and coverage types. The aim is to derive insights that inform strategic decisions and risk mitigation.
